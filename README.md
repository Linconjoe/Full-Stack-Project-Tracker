# 1990 GMC Sierra 383 Stroker Engine Swap & MPFI Conversion (Targeting 420+ HP)

## Project Overview

This project outlines the plan for fundamentally upgrading a 1990 GMC Sierra by **replacing its original 350 engine with a new BluePrint Engines 383 cubic inch (6.3L) Stroker Crate Engine**. This powerful engine comes with Vortec-style heads and is **EFI-ready**. The fuel delivery system will be upgraded to a **Multi-Port Fuel Injection (MPFI) system from ACES EFI (Wild Card™)**, aiming for an estimated output of **420+ horsepower and 450+ lb-ft of torque**.

The plan details the strategic installation of the crate engine, integration of the advanced MPFI system, and comprehensive reinforcement of supporting vehicle systems. A core principle of this project is to achieve significantly enhanced performance while maintaining the integrity, longevity, and **exceptional reliability for long-distance trips (6-7 hours)**.

This upgrade will provide a substantial increase in horsepower and torque, improved throttle response, and an overall enhanced driving experience, making the vehicle significantly more capable for various street and touring applications.

## Project Phases

The project phases have been re-scoped to reflect the crate engine swap and MPFI conversion:

### Phase 1: Original Engine Removal & Prep for Crate Engine

This initial phase involves safely removing the existing 350 engine and preparing the engine bay, chassis, and essential vehicle systems for the new, larger, and more powerful 383 Stroker crate engine and MPFI system. This includes ensuring clearance, inspecting engine mounts, and planning wiring/fuel line routing.

### Phase 2: Crate Engine & MPFI Installation

This is the core installation phase. It involves physically installing the BluePrint Engines 383 Stroker into the GMC Sierra. Concurrently, the ACES EFI Wild Card™ MPFI system will be integrated, including the intake manifold, fuel rails, injectors, wiring harness, and ECM. This phase will also involve initial connections for the ignition system and sensors specific to the MPFI setup.

#### Estimated Parts Costs for Phases 1 & 2 (Initial Major Purchases)

* **BluePrint 383 Stroker Crate Engine:** _(Insert current cost estimate once researched)_
* **ACES EFI Wild Card™ MPFI System:** _(Insert current cost estimate once researched)_
* **Mounts, Hoses, Fluids, Misc.:** ~$500 - $1000 (Initial estimates, highly variable)

### Phase 3: Supporting Systems & Driveline Reinforcement

Increased horsepower and torque necessitate robust supporting systems for thermal stability and power delivery. This phase focuses on upgrading the cooling system (radiator, fan, pump), reinforcing the driveline (transmission, driveshaft, rear end) to handle the increased power, and ensuring the **electrical system** adequately supports the new EFI and any high-draw components.

#### Estimated Parts Costs for Phase 3 (Updated)

* **Minimum Estimated Cost:** ~$2,065
* **Mid-Range Estimated Cost:** ~$3,100
    *(These are estimates for new or refurbished parts, avoiding high-end components, but will need review with the new HP target.)*

_Specific components (Cooling System, Alternator Upgrade, Driveline Upgrades) will need their details reviewed/updated based on the 420+ HP target._

### Phase 4: Initial Startup & Advanced MPFI Tuning

Tuning is paramount to unlock the full potential of the 383 Stroker with the ACES EFI MPFI system and ensure safe, efficient, and reliable operation across its entire range, especially for long-trip reliability. This phase includes initial system checks, engine break-in procedures, and detailed calibration of the ACES EFI engine management system.

#### Estimated Costs for Phase 4 (Updated)

* **Required Tools/Sensors (e.g., Wideband O2 Sensor):** ~$150 - $500 (Potentially included with ACES EFI kit)
* **Professional Dyno Tuning (Labor):** $750 - $1500+ (Highly recommended for optimal results and long-term reliability with the higher HP)
